      Today we’re conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If you’re
      about to run away screaming, I understand. I’m not sugarcoating it:
      croissants aren’t easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot of
      rolling. However, just because this recipe is advanced doesn’t mean that
      YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely handle this
      quintessential baking bucket list recipe. ♥ Let me hold your hand through
      the whole process. I’m sharing step-by-step photography, a full video
      tutorial, plenty of tricks based on what I’ve learned, and the croissant
      recipe. I started working on croissants earlier this year. I studied a
      couple recipes, tested them, tweaked what I found necessary, and played
      with this dough for weeks. The croissants are golden brown, extra flaky,
      crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and unbelievable warm from the
      oven. One bite of this delicate French pastry will immediately transport
      you to a quaint French bakery. I’m confident in this homemade croissants
      recipe and I’m confident in YOU baking them.
